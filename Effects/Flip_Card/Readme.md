Flip card design is quite common in web design. It can be applied to loads of places where information + pic are required in a fashion and eye-catching way.

The flip effect is mainly depends on setting `rotateY(180deg)` and ease the transition speed (.8s in this example). Using `transform-style:preserve-3d` to make the flipping looks real.
