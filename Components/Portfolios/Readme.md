# Image Gallery Portfolio

Portfolio is a common section in business website design. It's a place where can showcase the pictures of the projects, products and person.

The key effects was based on `transform: scaleY();` by which the objects (img or content) could be strech or shrink to desired sizes. And by slowing transisiton speed makes the effect more elegant.

No JQuery used!
