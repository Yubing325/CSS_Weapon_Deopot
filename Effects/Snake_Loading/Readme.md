# Snake Loading Animations

In my [CSS loading Animations repository](https://github.com/Yubing325/LoadingAnimations) I wrote several types of loading animations for web page loading. This time I've learned a more sophisticated effect regarding the loading animations. It can be applied to game related websites.

### Summary

This effect consist of server parts, the most important two I think are the "snake" animations in which it loop over a square shape. Another part is the backgroud square roates.

So two animations (`animate` and `roate`) are being created.
